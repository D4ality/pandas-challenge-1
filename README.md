# pandas-challenge-1
Utilized Xpert AI for assistance and StackOverflow for reference. The importation of the csv file was not working as intended via the local machine on Jupyter notebook. Error was mitigated by importing the os function to find the current directory of the file marked as 'FileNotFoundError' '[Errno2]'.
Received continuous 'invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?' prompts for each question after Part 2. Restarted the Kernel to no avail. Not sure what the issue is for the code in place. Double-checked the dictionaries that matched the structure of certain examples I studied. The brackets, commas, single quotes, double quotes, etc.
Perhaps I am overseeing something between the lines written? Xpert provided certain solutions to the matter, but it did not resolve the issue at stake. It only provided the solution to replace or remove the syntax, which I already did with no success.
Will continue to work and troubleshoot the matter after submission. Will attempt to resubmit with updated corrections. Technical issues with the Jupyter Notebook exacerbated the issue.
